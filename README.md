# Helmet_Detection
Object detection using convolutional neural networks and Yolov7 model. The main objective of the project is to detect whether people are wearing their safety helmets.<br>
The main idea is to train a CNN using two classes: <br>
- helmet for the case of a helmet on the head
- head for the case of the absence of a helmet on the head
